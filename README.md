# Deep-Learning

This repository contains two Python programs for my Deep Learning assignment. These programs focus on understanding and implementing basic concepts in Deep Learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and regression models.

Files Included

CNN_image_recognition.py, 
predict_house_prices.py

Credits: Original program by Joseph Lee.

How to Run the Programs

Install the required Python packages:
pip install keras tensorflow scikit-learn scipy h5py

Run the programs:
For the CNN program:
python CNN_image_recognition.py

For the house price prediction program:
python predict_house_prices.py



Credits
Both programs were originally written by Joseph Lee.
Modified by Kevin Dzitkowski for this assignment.
